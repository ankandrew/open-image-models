## Introduction

We aim to provide a variety of **pre-trained** models for different **computer vision** tasks, such as object detection and
image classification, that can be used **out-of-the-box** for **fast** inference using ONNX. These models are optimized for
performance and accuracy across various image sizes and tasks.

Models found here can easily be integrated into your applications for real-time processing, making them ideal for
deployment in edge devices, cloud environments, or production systems.

## Features

- üöÄ Pre-trained Models: Models are **ready** for immediate use, no additional training required.
- üîÑ ONNX Format: Cross-platform support for **fast inference** on both CPU and GPU environments.
- ‚ö° High Performance: Optimized for both speed and accuracy, ensuring efficient **real-time** applications.
- üìè Variety of Image Sizes: Models **available** with different input sizes, allowing flexibility based on the task's
  performance and speed requirements.
- üìä Evaluation Metrics: Precision, Recall, mAP50, and mAP50-95 metrics are provided for each model, helping users select
  the most appropriate model for their needs.
