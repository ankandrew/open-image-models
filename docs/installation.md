### Installation

```shell
pip install open-image-models
```

???+ info
    The models currently run using the ONNX framework. Depending on your system, you may want to install support for GPU
    or other hardware accelerators. Use optional extras like `gpu`, `openvino`, `directml`, or `qnn` to tailor the
    installation to your machine. For example: `pip install open-image-models[gpu]`.
